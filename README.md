# **Recipes Project**

---

## **Project Description**

This project is part of *The Odin Project* Foundations curriculum and focuses on creating a simple website to showcase recipes. The goal is to apply foundational HTML skills by structuring a website with a homepage and multiple linked recipe pages. Each recipe page includes essential information like the name of the dish, a brief description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for preparation.

Through this project, I practiced writing semantic HTML, organizing content effectively, and linking pages using relative paths.



## **Lessons Learned**

### 1. **Building a Website Structure**  
I learned how to create a clear and organized structure for a website, including a homepage and interconnected pages. This experience improved my understanding of using relative file paths to link HTML files and organize assets like images.

### 2. **Using Semantic HTML for Readability**  
This project emphasized the importance of using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better readability and accessibility. It also taught me to format content logically for easier maintenance and usability.

### 3. **Creating a Consistent Design Across Pages**  
While working on this project, I realized the value of maintaining consistency in styling and layout across pages. This practice ensures a cohesive user experience and sets the foundation for learning CSS in future projects.
