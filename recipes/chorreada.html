    <p>A <em>chorreada</em> is a traditional Costa Rican dish made from ground fresh corn mixed with a bit of water or milk to create a thick batter. It is cooked on a hot griddle or skillet into a round, flat pancake-like shape. Chorreadas are known for their soft texture and slightly sweet flavor, depending on the corn used. They are typically served fresh, accompanied by sour cream (natilla), fresh cheese, or even honey, making them a popular choice for breakfast or an afternoon snack.</p>
