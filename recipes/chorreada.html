    <h1>Chorreada</h1>
    <img src="../images/chorreada.jpg" alt="Chorreadas with natilla and corn">
    <p>A <em>chorreada</em> is a traditional Costa Rican dish made from ground fresh corn mixed with a bit of water or milk to create a thick batter. It is cooked on a hot griddle or skillet into a round, flat pancake-like shape. Chorreadas are known for their soft texture and slightly sweet flavor, depending on the corn used. They are typically served fresh, accompanied by sour cream (natilla), fresh cheese, or even honey, making them a popular choice for breakfast or an afternoon snack.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of fresh corn kernels (about 3-4 ears of corn)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of milk or water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of sugar (optional, depending on desired sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional, for a firmer texture)</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for greasing the skillet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Corn Batter:</strong> Blend the fresh corn kernels in a blender or food processor until you get a smooth mixture. Add the milk (or water), sugar (if desired), salt, and egg (optional). Blend until the batter has a thick, pourable consistency. Adjust with more milk or water if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Skillet:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chorreadas:</strong> Pour about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter onto the skillet, spreading it into a round, pancake-like shape. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and firm.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed between each chorreada.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Serve the chorreadas warm with sour cream (natilla), fresh cheese, honey, or any topping of your choice. Enjoy!</li>
