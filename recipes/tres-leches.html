    <h1>Tres Leches</h1>
    <img src="../images/tres-leches.jpg">
    <p>Tres Leches is a classic Latin American dessert, known for its moist texture and rich, sweet flavor. It gets its name from the three types of milk used to soak the sponge cake: evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream. This indulgent treat is often topped with whipped cream and garnished with cinnamon or fruit for added elegance.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the cake:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>⅓ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>For the milk mixture:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the topping:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon or fresh fruit (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cake:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with ¾ cup of the sugar until pale yellow and creamy. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining ¼ cup of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form</li>
            <li>Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture, then fold in the dry ingredients. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly</li>
            <li>Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Milk Mixture:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream. Whisk until well blended</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Tres Leches:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a fork or skewer to poke holes all over the cooled cake. Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, ensuring it soaks evenly. Refrigerate for at least 2–4 hours (or overnight) to let the cake absorb the liquid fully</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Topping:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a chilled bowl, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form</li>
            <li>Spread the whipped cream evenly over the soaked cake</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Serve and Garnish:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle with ground cinnamon or top with fresh fruit like strawberries or cherries, if desired</li>
            <li>Slice and serve chilled</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious Tres Leches Cake!</p>
